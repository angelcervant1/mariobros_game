# Inspired 2D Platform Game from Super Mario Bros. (Personal Project)

A side-scrolling platformer game inspired by Super Mario Bros, developed using Java and the Greenfoot educational IDE. This project recreates classic gameplay elements such as jumping mechanics, enemy interactions, level progression, and collectible items in a vibrant 2D environment.

## Project Features

- Modular Design: Leveraged object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to build clean, scalable, and reusable components.

- Gameplay Mechanics: Implemented gravity, jumping, enemy collisions, and score collection to enrich player experience.

- Level System: Designed a level-based progression system with increasing challenges and seamless transitions.

- Sprite Animation: Used sprite-based graphics for character movement, environment interaction, and visual feedback.


This project provided hands-on experience with Java fundamentals, OOP design patterns, and 2D game development, laying a strong foundation for more complex game and software engineering challenges.
